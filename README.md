## About Me
🎓   Finished 9-week full-time intensive coding bootcamp to learn Data Science.

🌱   Learned and Practiced Machine Learning with Scikit-learn; Deep Learning with TensorFlow Keras.

💼   Developed Data Products with Google Cloud Platform, ML Flow, Flask, Heroku and Streamlit.

✍️   Worked in Team of 4 on a project using deep learning methods to complete the image captioning and then combined an open API called GPT-3 to generate beautiful poetry according to information gathered from images. Bonus - we added a text-to-speech API to read the poetry in 3CPO's voice.
